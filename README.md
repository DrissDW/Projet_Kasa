Kasa is recruiting me as a freelance front-end developer to develop its new web platform.Kasa has been in the private apartment rental business for almost 10 years now. With more than 500 ads posted every day, Kasa is one of the leading apartment rental companies in France.

The Kasa site was coded over 10 years ago in ASP.NET, with a significant legacy code base. So Laura, the CTO, launched a complete overhaul to move to a full JavaScript stack with NodeJS on the back-end, and React on the front-end. Kasa also took the opportunity to commission new mock-ups from its regular freelance designer.


## **Objective**
Start the React project and develop the entire application, the React components, the React Router routes, following the Figma mockups (responsives!), taking into account the technical constraints and all the information provided by the CTO.


##  **Additional information**

* ### **Back-end** / **data**: 
Recruitment of the person in charge of the back-end is not yet complete and will take longer than expected. So I'll have to do without for the time being. I've been given the last 20 housing ads in this [JSON file](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Front-End+V2/P9+React+1/logements.json) so that I can build the corresponding front-end.

* ### **Technical constraints** : 
 Kasa's coding guidelines at this [link](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://course.oc-static.com/projects/D%C3%A9veloppeur+Web/IW_P8+React+Kasa/Kasa+coding+guidelines+-+IW+-+DW.pdf). The company usually uses create react app to **create React applications**. All CSS styles must be coded using **Sass**.

 * ### **Design**
